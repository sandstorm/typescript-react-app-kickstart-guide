## Prerequisites

These tools are needed to start developing.

```bash
# node version management
brew install nvm

# node (latest lts version)
nvm install --lts

# yarn
brew install yarn --without-node
```

## Editor
We recommend to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor. 
Install the following Extensions:
* `TSLint` -> linting support directly in editor ([marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin))
* `Type safe React & Redux Snippets in TypeScript` -> Snippets for boilerplate code as shown in Cookbook ([marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sandstorm.vscode-awesome-ts-react-redux-snippets))

## Cookbook
In the [cookbook](../cookbook/introduction) you will find skeletons for important modules. These skeletons are also available for VSCode as snippets in the VSCode [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sandstorm.vscode-awesome-ts-react-redux-snippets).
